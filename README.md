# Convx for Windows

The Windows version of [Convx](https://github.com/cosmictaserdev-creator/convx), the free music
app by [Aryan (Cosmic Taser)](https://github.com/cosmictaserdev-creator). Convx's author has made
this the official Windows version of Convx. It is maintained here by
[m33md](https://github.com/m33md), while Aryan keeps making the Android app.

It looks and works like the phone app, sized for a PC:

- Liquid glass on true black, in Convx's red, with a glass top bar, a library panel and a
  now-playing bar.
- Your YouTube Music account: Home, search, library, liked songs and playlists.
- The phone's lyrics styles, with word- and letter-synced lyrics.
- AutoMix transitions, an equalizer, Replay, and the AI features.
- Discord status, Last.fm and ListenBrainz scrobbling, and importing playlists from Spotify.
- Windows media keys and the taskbar's play controls.

## Download

**[Download the latest version](https://github.com/m33md/convx-desktop/releases/latest)** and run
`Convx-Setup-<version>.exe`.

If Windows says it protected your PC, click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. Convx updates
itself from the same page (Settings > Help & About > App updates).

You can also get an `.msi` installer, or a portable `.zip` that runs without installing, from the
same page.

## Build it yourself

You need JDK 21.

```
cd desktop
./gradlew run                 # start the app
./gradlew packageMsi          # Windows installer in build/compose/binaries/main/msi
```

Every push to `main` is built on GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/desktop.yml`), and the
finished installers replace the ones on the
[latest release](https://github.com/m33md/convx-desktop/releases/latest).

## How it's made

It is written in Kotlin with Compose Multiplatform. It compiles the phone app's own YouTube Music,
lyrics, artwork and song recognition code, so both apps fetch music the same way. Audio is
decoded with FFmpeg.

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `desktop/` | The Windows app |
| `innertube/`, `lyrics/`, `canvas/`, `integrations/` | Code from the Convx phone app: YouTube Music, lyrics, animated artwork and song recognition |
| `installer/windows/` | Convx's setup window (a WiX bundle around the app's MSI) |

The app keeps its data in two places on your PC:

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `%APPDATA%\Convx` | Library (likes, playlists, history) and settings |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Convx` | Song and artwork cache, logs |
